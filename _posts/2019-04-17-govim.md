title: govim - a Go development plugin for Vim8
location: London
author: paul

Command `github.com/myitcv/govim/cmd/govim` (referred to simply as `govim`) is a Go development plugin for Vim8, much
like [`vim-go`](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go). But unlike `vim-go`, `govim` is written in Go, not VimScript. It has
features like code completion, format-on-save, hover details and go-to definition, all of which are driven by
[`gopls`](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gopls), the Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for Go. See [the
wiki](https://github.com/myitcv/govim/wiki/govim-plugin-API) for more feature details. Installation instructions can be
found in the [main `README`](https://github.com/myitcv/govim/blob/master/README.md).

Package [`github.com/myitcv/govim`](https://godoc.org/github.com/myitcv/govim) provides an API for plugin developers to
interface with Vim8 in Go, i.e. write Vim8 plugins in Go rather than VimScript. More details
[here](https://github.com/myitcv/govim/blob/master/PLUGIN_AUTHORS.md).

The [FAQ](https://github.com/myitcv/govim/wiki/FAQ) covers a number of important questions, including:

* Why have you created govim? What is/was wrong with vim-go?
* What versions of Vim and Go are supported with govim?
* Why should I use govim over vim-go/vim-lsp/...?
* ...

I've given two talks on `govim`, the first at [London Gophers](https://gophers.london):

The second at [Vim London](https://www.meetup.com/Vim-London/), in which I go into more details on the Vim side, as well
as covering how the plugin is tested:
