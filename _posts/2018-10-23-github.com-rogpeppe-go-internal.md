Packages [`github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal/...`](https://godoc.org/github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal) represent an
opinionated selection of internal packages and functionality factored out from the Go standard library and `cmd/go`.
This work was started by [Roger Peppe](https://twitter.com/rogpeppe?lang=en), with contributions from [Daniel
Mart√≠](https://twitter.com/mvdan_?lang=en) and myself.

It includes:

* `cache`: Package cache implements a build artifact cache.
* `cmd/testscript`: Package testscript provides support for defining filesystem-based tests by creating scripts in a
  directory.
* `lockedfile`: Package lockedfile creates and manipulates files whose contents should only change atomically.
* `modfile`: Package modfile implements parsing and formatting for go.mod files.
* `module`: Package module defines the module.Version type along with support code.
* `par`: Package par implements parallel execution helpers.
* `renameio`: Package renameio writes files atomically by renaming temporary files.
* `semver`: Package semver implements comparison of semantic version strings.
* `testscript`: Package testscript provides support for defining filesystem-based tests by creating scripts in a
  directory.
* `txtar`: Package txtar implements a trivial text-based file archive format.

See the [docs for `github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal`](https://godoc.org/github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal) for a more
current and complete list.

Issues [#28101](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28101) and [#31761](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/31761) track
the more official exporting of these packages.
