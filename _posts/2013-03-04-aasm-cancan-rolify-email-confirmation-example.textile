This example builds a simple email verification system based principally on an @aasm@ state machine. 

It uses the following gems/concepts:

| _.@gem@ / Concept | Usage |
| "@haml@":https://github.com/haml/haml, "@haml-rails@":https://github.com/indirect/haml-rails, "@haml-contrib@":https://github.com/haml/haml-contrib, "@RedCloth@":https://github.com/jgarber/redcloth | Layout and markup for rendering. Along with @bootstrap-sass@ this builds on a "previous example for building simple HTML5 applications":/2013/03/10/rails-application-example-using-html5-and-haml.html|
| "@bootstrap-sass@":https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass | Twitter-based styling. See above comment |
| "@aasm@":https://github.com/aasm/aasm | Used to define the state machine behind our user email confirmation system. The state machine is defined with our @User@ model |
| "@rolify@":https://github.com/EppO/rolify, "@cancan@":https://github.com/ryanb/cancan | Used in combination to define an admin role but also the actions individual users can perform on @User@ instances |
| "@omniauth-google-oauth2@":https://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2 | We authenticate the entire application using @omniauth@, specifically @omniauth-google-oauth2@. This builds on a "previous example using this gem":/2013/02/19/omniauth-google-oauth2-example.html |
| "@figaro@":https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro | Used for our environment management. Again, build on a "previous example":/2013/03/10/using-figaro-and-bash-for-a-smoother-development-config-environment.html |
| "@bootstrap_forms@":https://github.com/sethvargo/bootstrap_forms | Simple but useful gem to cut down on the amount of layout coding when using @bootstrap-sass@ and @form_for@. See "the project page":https://github.com/sethvargo/bootstrap_forms for more information |
| "@mail@":https://github.com/mikel/mail | Used to verify email address supplied by our users are of a valid format. Again "build on a previous example":/2013/03/14/validators-in-rails-using-email-as-an-example.html |
| "@draper@":https://github.com/drapergem/draper | Used to encapsulate the presentation of model fields. The "project page":https://github.com/drapergem/draper contains good documentation |
| @ActiveRecord::Observer@|To detect the edge changes in @User@ state and send a confirmation request email when appropriate. The docs "provide a good starting point":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Observer.html |
| @ActionMailer@|To send the confirmation request email. The "Ruby on Rails Guide":http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html is the best place to start |

The commited code is setup to work with "OpenShift":https://openshift.redhat.com/

A complete walk-through of the example will be posted at a later date, but for now the entire project is "posted to GitHub":https://github.com/myitcv/email-confirm-state-example
