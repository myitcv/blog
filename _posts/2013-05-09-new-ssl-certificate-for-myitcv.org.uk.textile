Visitors to "myitcv.org.uk":http://myitcv.org.uk might have noticed that the SSL certificate for the domain has changed recently. 

For most modern operating systems (and browsers) this should not present a problem. But for those with older systems, particularly systems that have not been patched/updated fully (a particular example that came up the other day was an old Windows XP machine that appeared to be missing any sort of update to its root certificates), you might receive warnings in your browser that the "identity of the site cannot be verified."

If you are experiencing problems, you simply need to download and install the following GoDaddy SSL certificates:

* "Go Daddy Class 2 Certification Authority Root Certificate":https://certs.godaddy.com/anonymous/repository.pki?streamfilename=gd-class2-root.crt&actionMethod=anonymous%2Frepository.xhtml%3Arepository.streamFile%28%27%27%29&cid=2438891
* "Go Daddy Class 2 Certification Authority Root Certificate - G2":https://certs.godaddy.com/anonymous/repository.pki?streamfilename=gdroot-g2.crt&actionMethod=anonymous%2Frepository.xhtml%3Arepository.streamFile%28%27%27%29&cid=2438891

And then upgrade your operating system!
