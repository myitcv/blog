__*Edit*: I previously upgraded my machine using a "Crucial SSD":http://www.crucial.com/store/partspecs.aspx?imodule=CT256V4SSD2. This was quite simply the worst piece of hardware I have ever bought.... Switched to the Samsung 830 (see below) and so far things are about 100 times better...__

I recently upgraded my MacBook Pro hard drive from the old 5,400 RPM mechanical dinosaur to a sparkly new SSD drive along with a RAM upgrade to boot (pun intended). Not a perfectly straightforward process so I share below a few useful steps to consider.

# Working out my MacBook Pro model name [MacBookPro5,4 === MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2.53GHz, Mid 2009)] proved more difficult perhaps it should have been. In the end "this page from Apple"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4132 proved my saviour
# Samsung provided the the "SSD":http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-830-Series-MZ-7PC256N-Internal/dp/B005T3GPXY and Crucial provided the "memory":http://www.crucial.com/store/mpartspecs.aspx?mtbpoid=62EB01A3A5CA7304 upgrades. I ignored the fact my machine "does not support SATA III":http://forum.notebookreview.com/apple-mac-os-x/560226-sata-3-ssd-worth-getting.html and went ahead with the Samsung drive on quality grounds
# Installing the new "memory":http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing+MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Unibody+2.53+GHz+Mid+2009+RAM/1522/1 and "SSD":http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Unibody+2.53+GHz+Mid+2009+Hard+Drive+Replacement/1518/1 was super easy; instructions provided by "iFixIt":http://www.ifixit.com/. But worth noting the special screwdrivers needed for the hard drive upgrade - I got by with suitably sized flat head instead of the 5-Point Pentalobe listed
# Installed Mountain Lion
# Performed an Apple Software update immediately after installing Mountain Lion; at the time of writing this brought me up to 10.8.2
# Followed guidelines on how to optimise (Mountain) Lion for a third-party SSD. I followed "instructions from Grant Pannell on how to enable TRIM":http://digitaldj.net/2011/07/21/trim-enabler-for-lion/ and "general advice from Martin on other tweaks":http://blog.alutam.com/2012/04/01/optimizing-macos-x-lion-for-ssd/ (obviously I skipped Martin's step on enabling TRIM) 

Hope this saves somebody some time if they are considering the same upgrade.
