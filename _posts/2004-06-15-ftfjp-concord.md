My final year thesis at the [Department of Computing](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/computing/), [Imperial
College](http://www.ic.ac.uk) focused on object oriented programming languages. My supervisor was the brilliant [Sophia
Drossopoulou](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~scd/). Along with [Christopher Anderson](http://www.lyonanderson.org/) and [Klaus
Ostermann](http://www.informatik.uni-marburg.de/~kos/) we used my thesis as the basis of a paper that was presented at
[6th Workshop on Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs - FTfJP'2004](http://www.cs.ru.nl/ftfjp/2004.html) on 15 June
2004:

> We suggest a simple model for a restricted form of dependent types in object oriented languages, whereby classes belong
> to groups and dependency is introduced via intra-group references using the MyGrp keyword. We show how our approach can
> code well-known examples from the literature, present the formal model and outline soundness of the type system.
