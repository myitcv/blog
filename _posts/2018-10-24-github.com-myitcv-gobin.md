[`github.com/myitcv/gobin`](https://github.com/myitcv/gobin) is an experimental, module-aware command to install/run main packages.

Compared to the Go 1.11 series `cmd/go`, with `gobin` you:

* get some of the behaviour of `go get`, `go install` and `go run` combined
* can have multiple versions of a tool available without needing to worry about setting `PATH`
* have the equivalent of `go get` whilst in module-aware mode but this does not modify your `go.mod`; indeed you can
  choose whether you want to run in global mode (the default) or main-module mode for the install/run operation
* can run a main package without the overhead of the linking phase, e.g. within code generation

More detailed on the rationale etc are covered in [the main
`README`](https://github.com/myitcv/gobin/blob/master/README.md) and [the
FAQ](https://github.com/myitcv/gobin/wiki/FAQ).

`gobin` is an experiment, as such there are no expectations over its future.

There are a number of potential outcomes, not limited to the following list:

* it dies; the hypothesis being tested by `gobin` proves incorrect, unworkable etc
* it lives on as a separate tool outside of the Go distribution
* parts of `gobin` are absorbed into the `cmd/go` tool
* a variant of gobin is vendored and distributed alongside the `cmd/go` tool, much like `godoc` was in in Go 1.11 and earlier
* ...

As ever, contributions in the form of feedback, issues and PRs, greatly appreciated.
