In March/April/May 2013 I am planning to run a course at [London Business School](http://www.london.edu) that perhaps
best falls under the title of "Introduction to Coding for Business Students."

The course will be aimed at those who have never coded before (or at most done a little VBA/Access/SQL hacking) and has
three main goals:

* Produce a working but very much "toy" web application (written using Ruby on Rails)
* Provide an introduction to development workflow and in the process give some insight into a programmer's perspective
(and to a lesser extent, the perspective of designers)
* Offer a primer on programming literacy

At this stage I'm broadly thinking this will be run over 6 three-hour sessions with some take-home work to reinforce the
lesson's teaching.

So what will students 'touch' in the process:

* Virtual machines (VirtualBox)
* Linux (Ubuntu)
* Ruby on Rails via RVM
* git and GitHub

The more technical aspects of setting up development environments for teaching are covered in the [following
post](/2013/02/18/introducing-people-to-coding-the-vagrant-and-puppet-way.html)

So for now this page is a simple placeholder for the course but if you have any questions please [get in
touch](mailto:paul@myitcv.org.uk)
