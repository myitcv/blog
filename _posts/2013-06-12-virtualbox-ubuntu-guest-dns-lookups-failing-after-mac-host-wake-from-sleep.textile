title: VirtualBox Ubuntu guest DNS lookups failing after Mac host wake from sleep

I run "Ubuntu Linux":http://www.ubuntu.com/ as a guest operating system within "VirtualBox":https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads on my "MacBook Pro":http://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro/

Often (and for some reason more often than not lately) when I open my Mac to wake it from sleeping, Ubuntu has lost the ability to do a DNS lookup. @ping@ to any IP address works, but DNS is entirely broken.

"This problem was reported":https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10864 in Oct 2012 and reported as being fixed in version @>= 4.1@ of VirtualBox. At the time of writing I am running @4.2.12@ and yet still see the problem. The solution for now appears to be to run the following command from the host (as the previously linked bug report suggests):

{% highlight bash %}
VBoxManage modifyvm VMNAME --natdnshostresolver1 on
{% endhighlight %}
