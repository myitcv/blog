At [GopherCon 2018](https://www.gophercon.com), I attended the Go Contributor Summit with the hope of participating in a
session where we could discuss [Go Modules](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Modules__module_versions__and_more), tooling,
editor/IDE support and the like. Then Marcel, Ian and Robert rained on my parade with the [Go 2 Design
Drafts](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft.md)!

But I got chatting to Ian Cottrell about [`go/packages`](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/go/packages), tooling,
editor/IDE support for Go amongst other things, and thought it would be useful to gather interested parties at GopherCon
to talk about all of these topics in the context of Go modules, but also generally where things are heading.

We did a best-efforts job of gathering a list of folks at GopherCon we thought would be interested in such a session. I
also augmented that list with folks I knew would also be interested but were unfortunately not at GopherCon.

And so at GopherCon 2018 we held the first [`golang-tools`](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/golang-tools) session.
What started as a kick-off meeting is now:

* a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-tools)
* an active [Gophers Slack](https://gophers.slack.com/) `#tools` channel ([sign
  up](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org))
* monthly Google Hangout [catch-up calls](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/golang-tools#catch-up-calls)

Each of the catch up sessions is recorded and published on YouTube, along with notes summarising discussion ([link to
published notes/recordings](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/golang-tools#catch-up-calls)).

The group is open to everyone, especially those with an interest in build tools to work with the Go programming
language.
