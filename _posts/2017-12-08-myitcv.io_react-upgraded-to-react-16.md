Following the [release of React `16.2.0`](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/11/28/react-v16.2.0-fragment-support.html),
[`myitcv.io/react`](https://myitcv.io/react) has been upgraded to bundle React 16 by default. Per [the
README](https://github.com/myitcv/x/blob/master/react/_doc/README.md), React 15 support is being maintained on [a
branch](https://github.com/myitcv/react/tree/react_15).

Support is also included for [Fragments](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html):

> "A common pattern in React is for a
component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the
DOM."

Here is an example of a `react.Fragment` being used:

```go
func (a AppDef) Render() react.Element {
  return react.Fragment(
    react.H1(nil,
            react.S("Hello World"),
    ),
    react.P(nil,
            react.S("This is my first GopherJS React App."),
    ),
  )
}
```

Please [raise any issues on Github](https://github.com/myitcv/x/issues/new?title=react:).
