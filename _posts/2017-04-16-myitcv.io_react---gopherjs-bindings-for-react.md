[`myitcv.io/react`](https://godoc.org/myitcv.io/react) ([source](https://github.com/myitcv/react)) is a set of
[GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) bindings for Facebook's [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), a
Javascript library for building interactive user interfaces.

```bash
go get -u myitcv.io/react
```

This is not the first attempt at creating bindings for React:

* [`github.com/bep/gr`](https://github.com/bep/gr) and
  [`github.com/leeola/go-react`](https://github.com/leeola/go-react) are two currently active alternatives
* [`github.com/gopherjs/vecty`](https://github.com/gopherjs/vecty) is a React-like frontend tool-kit from the makers of
  GopherJS

`myitcv.io/react` takes a slightly different approach to all the above, making extensive use of code generation to make
the writing of components in Go code as lightweight, simple and idiomatic as possible.

This blog post walks you through creating your first GopherJS React web application.

## Overview

GopherJS is a [transpiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler), that re-writes Go source code into
Javascript code. GopherJS's principal target is Javascript that will be loaded within the browser (as opposed to
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) which is more server or CLI-based) and so is ideally suited to web applications
that need an interactive user interface.

React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces. Components are the fundamental building block of a React
application. Components have their own state and can easily be composed to make more complex user interfaces.

`myitcv.io/react` is a Go package that allows you to build React components and web applications. Components are
declared in Go code that is then transpiled using GopherJS into Javascript code that is loaded within the browser via an
HTML page like any other web app.

[Hello World](http://blog.myitcv.io/gopherjs_examples_sites/helloworld/) is an example GopherJS React application.

## Writing your own web app

The simplest way to start a new web app is via `reactGen`. With `reactGen` we can initialise a new web app but it is
also acts as the code generator that generates helper methods and functions as we write our React components. More of
that later.


Let's first create a directory for our new web app<sup>[&dagger;](#footnote1)</sup>:

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/example.com/helloworld
```

Now let's ensure we have the relevant packages available and that our `PATH` environment variable is set correctly:

```bash
go get -u github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs
go get -u myitcv.io/{react,react/cmd/reactGen}

# amend PATH to include target for gopherjs and reactGen
export PATH="$(dirname $(go list -f '{{.Target}}' myitcv.io/react/cmd/reactGen)):$PATH"
```

At this point you should be able to run `reactGen -help` to check it outputs something like:

```
Usage:
        ./reactGen [-init <template>]
        ./reactGen [-gglog <log_level>] [-licenseFile <filepath>] [-core]

  -core
        indicates we are generating for a core component (only do props expansion)
  -gglog string
        log level; one of info, warning, error, fatal (default "fatal")
  -init value
        create a GopherJS React application using the specified template (see below)
  -licenseFile string
        file that contains a license header to be inserted at the top of each generated file

The flag -init only understands a single value for now: minimal. This is a minimal
Gopher React application.

...
```

Let's now create a template GopherJS web app:

```bash
# change into the directory we created earlier
cd $GOPATH/src/example.com/helloworld

reactGen -init minimal
```

We can now tell GopherJS to serve our web application to see the fruits of our labour:

```bash
gopherjs serve
```

If you navigate to [http://localhost:8080/example.com/helloworld](http://localhost:8080/example.com/helloworld) the
resulting web app should look something like this:

![Hello World]({{ site.url }}/images/2017-04-16-react-helloworld.png)

The following list roughly summarises the sequence of events:

* `reactGen -init minimal` creates our basic web app: `app.go`, `gen_App_reactGen.go`, `index.html` and `main.go`. This
  is essentially a Go `main` package (with the import path `example.com/helloworld` given the directory in which we
  created it)
* `main.go` declares the `main()` function; `app.go` declares a basic React component,
  [`App`](https://github.com/myitcv/react/blob/c336a0f015a717172fe23f04ac441b982c9252db/examples/sites/helloworld/app.go#L9-L28),
  which renders the simple `<div>`, `<h1>` and `<p>` elements that make up our web app
* `gopherjs serve` effectively does two things: transpiles the `.go` files into `helloworld.js` and then serves
  `index.html` and `helloworld.js` from `http://localhost:8080/example.com/helloworld`<sup><a
  href="#footnote2">&ddagger;</a></sup>
* The browser loads `index.html` and in the process loads `helloworld.js` via the [`<script>`
  directive](https://github.com/myitcv/react/blob/c336a0f015a717172fe23f04ac441b982c9252db/examples/sites/helloworld/index.html#L13):

```html
<script src="helloworld.js"></script>
```

* Because our `helloworld` package is a `main` package, a side effect of loading `helloworld.js` is to run the [`main()`
  function](https://github.com/myitcv/react/blob/c336a0f015a717172fe23f04ac441b982c9252db/examples/sites/helloworld/main.go#L15-L19)
  the package declares. This is therefore the entry point for our web application:

```go
func main() {
	domTarget := document.GetElementByID("app")
	r.Render(App(), domTarget)
}
```

* React renders the `App` component within the `<div>` with ID `"app"` which we see declared in `index.html`

Once `r.Render` is called, we effectively hand-off into the React world and the [React Component
Lifecycle](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html) takes over.


## Creating a new component

The `App` component created as part of the skeleton web app is very basic. Let's look at creating our own component,
`FooBar`, within the `example.com/helloworld` package and amending the `App` component to use `FooBar`. `FooBar` will
define some simple props and maintain some basic state to demonstrate the two key aspects of React components. The code
that follows defines the component and the code comments describe important aspects of the code:

```go
// foo_bar.go

package main

import (
	"fmt"

	// it's normal to name the import of myitcv.io/react with something like
	// "r" because it's used repeatedly. Dot imports are strongly discouraged
	// per the core Go team's advice on this subject.
	//
	r "myitcv.io/react"
)

//go:generate reactGen

// FooBarDef is the definition of the FooBar component. All components are
// declared with a *Def suffix and an embedded myitcv.io/react.ComponentDef
// field
//
type FooBarDef struct {
	r.ComponentDef
}

// FooBarProps is the props type for the FooBar component. All props types are
// declared as a struct type with a *Props suffix
//
type FooBarProps struct {
	Name string
}

// FooBarState is the state type for the FooBar component. All state types are
// declared as a struct type with a *State suffix
//
type FooBarState struct {
	Count int
}

// FooBar is the constructor for a FooBar component. Given that this component
// can take props (can, not must), we add a parameter of type *FooBarProps
//
func FooBar(p FooBarProps) *FooBarDef {
	res := new(FooBarDef)

	// every component constructor must call this function
	r.BlessElement(res, p)

	return res
}

// Render is a required method on all React components. Notice that the method
// is declared on a pointer type *FooBarDef.
//
func (f *FooBarDef) Render() r.Element {

	// all React components must render under a single root. This is typically achieved
	// by rendering everything within a <div> elememt
	//
	return r.Div(nil,
		r.P(nil,
			r.S(fmt.Sprintf("My name is %v. My age is %v", f.Props().Name, f.State().Count)),
		),
		r.Button(
			&r.ButtonProps{
				OnClick: f.bumpAge,
			},
			r.S("Bump age"),
		),
	)
}

// bumpAge is the callback for a button press
//
func (f *FooBarDef) bumpAge(e *r.SyntheticMouseEvent) {
	s := f.State()
	s.Count++
	f.SetState(s)
}
```

At this point we need to run [`go generate`](https://blog.golang.org/generate) within the directory
`$GOPATH/src/example.com/helloworld` to generate the helper methods and functions that complete our definition of the
`FooBar` component. Once you have run `go generate` you will see that the file `gen_FooBar_reactGen.go` has been
created.

Now let's update the `App` component's `Render()` method:

```go
func (a *AppDef) Render() r.Element {
	return r.Div(nil,
		r.H1(nil,
			r.S("Hello World"),
		),
		r.P(nil,
			r.S("This is my first GopherJS React App."),
		),
		FooBar(FooBarProps{Name: "Peter"}),
	)
}
```

Now refresh the page in your browser and the we should see something like:


![Hello World 2]({{ site.url }}/images/2017-04-16-react-helloworld2.png)

Clicking the button bumps Peter's age as expected.

At this point it's left to the reader to examine the definition of `FooBar` above and understand how the props and state
are used within the `Render()` method.
